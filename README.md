# Brand Sentiment Analyzer ðŸš€

This project is a **BERT-powered sentiment analysis web app** for analyzing brand reviews and customer feedback.

## Features
âœ… Predict sentiment (Positive, Negative, Uncertain) for single text input.  
âœ… Upload CSV files and get batch predictions with confidence scores.  
âœ… Download analyzed results as CSV.  
âœ… Built using **Streamlit**, **Transformers**, and **PyTorch**.  
âœ… Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy access.

## How It Works
- Fine-tuned `bert-base-uncased` model on IMDB data for binary sentiment classification.
- Confidence thresholding ensures reliable predictions.
- The app processes text inputs or CSV files and outputs sentiment predictions.

## Future Work
- Fine-tune BERT on **brand-specific datasets** for improved accuracy.
- Expand to **multimodal sentiment analysis** (text + image).
- Deploy as a **full-scale web service** for brands.

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
